						Several weeks ago, as part of our Dev Bootcamp prep phase, we had to take a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">quiz</a> that would help determine our Gregorc Thinking Style so we could be more aware of how we think and learn. With this knowledge we could adjust our training so we could be more successful, hopefully. There are 4 types of mind styles and we could have some atributes of each, although most likely one or two would be dominant.

						Pairing was something I was initial afraid to do. It was another opportunity to expose my knowledge, or lack there of, to others in an environment where I could be critized. In prior pairing sessions, my experiences were not pleasant and seemed a waste of at least one person's time. The person driving did all the work and the other person was left out of the process other than to watch and do small talk. But at Dev Bootcamp, I have learned how to pair correctly.

						Often we need to sort data as part of our processing logic, and it is also a common interview question to construct a sort. There various methods to generate a sorted list of items. In this post I will take a look at sorting array data with Ruby. I will look at merge sort, quick sort and the bubble sort.

					<p>
						Blogging did not come easily for me. It's like flossing. You kow you should do it, and you are better for having done it, but it just does not flow like coding does. A couple of years ago, I signed up for an account with WordPress, and went through the process of customizing the look of the site, but I could not get myself to write anything. I felt that I would be judged by what I wrote and so any topic I chose, I had to know as much as anyone and do a really great job on it.

					<p>
						Revisit your "Affirming your Values" blog post and relate it to what you learned about stereotype threat.
						How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat

						feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?

					<p>
						SQL Injection is a form of web attack in which the attacking software (bot) attempts to learn about the database of a website, 
						or to alter the database or data, by passing extra SQL commands as part of data being sent to a web server by a web page.
						Most commonly, this works by the bot appending SQL commands to a form field that is then sent and 
						executed against a database as in this example from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">Wikipedia</a>.
						An innocent select statement can be altered into something malicious.

					<p>
						What is stereotype threat? It is a condition that can affect minorities and women in which their performance of a task can confirm a negative stereotype of their group despite their abilities being better. This performance hit is caused by anxiety caused by having to prove an attribute, like intelligence, and thinking that it would be viewed in racial or gender terms.

					<p>
						Object Oriented Programming (OO) and Functional programming are two very different approaches to writing programs. OO approaches programming with classes as the main construct to create programs. Functional programming uses functions as the main construct.

					<p>
						There is a debate raging in the software community about software quality. Specifically the lack of it, or more likely, the mis-placement of it. Many of us became aware of quality issues in the recent launch of the government medical insurance site, healthcare.gov. Where the system could not handle the volume of users an possibly did not function even when the demand was down. And if you are a Rails developer, you have probably heard <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3315-railsconf-keynote-writing-software">David Heinemeier Hansson's talk</a> about unit testing and Test Driven Development (TDD).

						Classes are an important component of Ruby programming. They can be used to model
						real objects that have properties and behavior. In Ruby the properties are called instance variables. The behavior happens in methods. With these, one can simulate almost anything.

					<p>
						Many years ago, when I was new to a company. The VP of sales and I would come into conflict often as we both had strong opinions of how our product should look and work. We both used the "Attack Other" quadrant of the Compass of Shame to try and push through the group what we felt was best for the product and clients. It was frustrating. Sometimes I would win and sometimes I would lose.

					<p>
						Map is a method of the enumerable class. It is considered one of the most important functional methods in Ruby. It works by iterating over the elements of an array, returning an array which is composed of the results of the block that is executed on each element. If no block is provided an enumerator is returned for each element of the array. From <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-map">Ruby Docs</a> we see the following code example.

						This week we watched a video by Shereef Bishay. Although the video was recorded about a year an a half ago, he explains the Dev Bootcamp experience from how it started to how it still works today. That experience can best be described by the title of this week's blog: Chefs in the Kitchen. The meaning behind this is that instead of a traditional learning environment where the curriculum is detailed and served to you like a meal in a restaurant, at Dev Bootcamp, the student is placed in the kitchen and invited to get involved in the creative process with the chefs.

						JavaScript's current popularity did not happen overnight. It was created in 1995
						by Brendan Eich at Netscape to give some small scripting ability to their Navigator
						browser. Since then the language has slowly improved over time and become a
						language known by all web developers.

						Every HTML element on a web page occupies a space that can be thought of as a box. In web design terms this is referred to as the &quot;Box Model&quot;. This box is composed of four parts: the content, the padding, the border, and the margin.
