						<h1>Dealing with Conflict</h1>

					<p>
						Many years ago, when I was new to a company. The VP of sales and I would come into conflict often as we both had strong opinions of how our product should look and work. We both used the "Attack Other" quadrant of the Compass of Shame to try and push through the group what we felt was best for the product and clients. It was frustrating. Sometimes I would win and sometimes I would lose.
					</p>
					<p>
						While both of us argued over what was to be done, it never got personal. Several times we realized that we really were arguing the same position, but using different words. Eventually I think we both realized that we really had more in common on how the product should go. I am not sure how it started, but at some point, we began to compromise and give in to the others point of view now and again.
					<p>
					<p>
						After a few months, a new project came along and we decided to take our discussions into a sererate meeting. We would try sketching and designing the UI, and functionality of the new product in seperate meetings with the two of us working on it. At first there was some conflict as we went through how things should work. But as we drew out the screens, content and buttons, the tone softened as we learned to collaborate and create something new. We would go on to create two other major product enhancements, and many smaller projects. All were done using our collaborative process instead of the original aggressive pushing approach. We became friends and actually ended up enjoying the collaborative process even with the ocassional conflicts.
					</p>
					<p>
						If I could have done this differently, I would have liked to skip right to the collaborative interaction, but I think we had to have the aggressive push and pull conflicts first to get to that point. I feel that since neither side was forced to be the loser, or was humiliated in the conflict, we were able to first allow some concessions and eventually move to collaboration.
