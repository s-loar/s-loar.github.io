					<h1>Exploring My Values</h1>
				</header>

				<p>
					1) When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?
					<ul>
						<li>Accomplishment</li>
						<li>Enthusiasm</li>
						<li>Excitement</li>
						<li>Inspiration</li>
						<li>Pleasure</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					2) Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.
					<br /><br />
					Excitement. This is an easy choice as when I am happy, or proud, or most satisfied, something has just happened and there is excitement over this event. It is best when that excitement is shared with others, as it brings us closer.
				</p>
				<p>
					3) Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:<br />
					In general, I try to live up to these values:<br />
					Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
					<br /><br />
					Some of these are easier to live up to than others. So probably a 3. It is generally easier to try to be enthusiastic and inspired than say pleasured or accomplished.
				</p>
				<p>
					4) What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?
					<br /><br />
					I am not sure, but I am guessing that the other programmer I work with was having an issue getting a file upload to work and he felt stuck and wanted my input. I have learned that often when people are stuck like this, the best thing I can do is listen to them explain the issue in detail, maybe ask a few questions about how things are working or what happens. Then in almost every case, they normally find the solution on their own from just telling it to me.
