					<p>
						SQL Injection is a form of web attack in which the attacking software (bot) attempts to learn about the database of a website, 
						or to alter the database or data, by passing extra SQL commands as part of data being sent to a web server by a web page.
						Most commonly, this works by the bot appending SQL commands to a form field that is then sent and 
						executed against a database as in this example from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">Wikipedia</a>.
						An innocent select statement can be altered into something malicious.
					</p>

					<p class="codesnippet">
						# our innocent select statement. Probably part of an HTTP GET call.<br />
						statement = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name ='" + userName + "';"<br /><br />
						
						# the attacking bot puts this into our userName field<br />
						a';DROP TABLE users; SELECT * FROM userinfo WHERE 't' = 't<br /><br />
						
						# This then becomes<br />
						SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'a';DROP TABLE users; SELECT * FROM userinfo WHERE 't' = 't';
					</p>

					<p>
						I first learned of SQL Injection attacks several years ago by attending a talk given by 
						<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">OWASP</a>.
						They are an organization that seeks to educate about such threats and come up with defenses against them. The talk went through
						what SQL intrusion was and how to defend against it. Among the things they recommend was scrubbing the data or using parametized 
						input in stored procedures.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I presented what I learned from OWASP to my management, I was told that they were not interested in this, as it was an unlikely issue 
						and besides, there was a back up of the database made each night. When the attack came 2 or 3 weeks later, it was discovered that the 
						back up software could not back up any file that was in use when the backup ran and since the database was always in use, there was no 
						back up. We were lucky, in that the only damage done was that the data of one column of one table was changed to something like 
						"Kilroy has hacked this site". We were able to restore that data manually, and we were then given permission to start protecting the 
						site from further attacks.
					</p>
					<p>
						Initially, we took two approaches to defend against these attacks. First, all numeric HTTP POST form input and HTTP GET parameters 
						were converted to real number data types before being used in SQL queries or commands. Second, all text data passed in requests, 
						were scrubbed by replacing all single quotes with two single quotes. These changes eliminated the threat from a bot stringing 
						multiple commands into one form field. Parametized input was not a good option for us, as the system was constantly changing.
					</p>
					<p>
						As I worked to prevent future attacks, I became interested in what these attacks were, and how often did we get hit with a probe or attack. 
						I put logging in place where I could catch them, and the defense of converting numbers in requests caused a lot of errors, which where 
						caught and logged in detail. I was surprised that our site was either being probed for an attack, or attacked, constantly, at 
						least once a minute around the clock. Sometimes these attacks would increase in intensity to dozens or more per second for 
						periods of 10 or 15 minutes. I also observed that the bots techniques change over time, altering their attack strategy. 
						And that they gave more of their attention to pages that generate errors than those that act like nothing happened. 
						I also saw that they strip out all JavaScript, so nothing could be done with that to impact the attacks.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today, we defend against the bots with some additional defenses. In addition to sanitizing the numbers and text, we also gracefully 
						handle the data that would have generated an error in the past. We catch that bad input and then send them to a safe page without 
						generateing any error, or running any SQL scripts. We also put hidden fields on the forms. With JavaScript, we can catch anything a 
						person might put in a hidden field and ask them to remove it, but since the field is hidden, people do not see it, so no problem. 
						But the bots do see them and they always fill in every field. So we catch that on the server side of a POST, and redirect them 
						to another safe page. We are also starting to use more JavaScript and AJAX driven frameworks, like Backbone.js, and since the bots 
						strip out the JavaScript, those pages probably offer nothing to the bots. I have seen no probes or attacks on these pages, yet.
					</p>
					<p>
						SQL Intrusion is a significant threat that must be defended against. I outlined some defenses you can use above. I strongly 
						recommend you use them at the start of a project, not after you get hacked. It's worth the extra time it takes to build in 
						these defenses to prevent the catastrophic hacking of your database. Want more encouragement, on a new site, you can expect 
						your first attacks to start arriving within 30 minutes of taking it live, so why not prepare for that up front.
