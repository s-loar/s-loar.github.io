						Blogging did not come easily for me. It's like flossing. You kow you should do it, and you are better for having done it, but it just does not flow like coding does. A couple of years ago, I signed up for an account with WordPress, and went through the process of customizing the look of the site, but I could not get myself to write anything. I felt that I would be judged by what I wrote and so any topic I chose, I had to know as much as anyone and do a really great job on it.
					</p>
					<p>
						For a while I tried posting things I learned to Twitter. I still do that, but I realize that Twitter is more like a party where people are making small talk, not delving in to heavy technical or personal topics.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now I signed up for Dev Bootcamp, and I have to blog. And I cannot take forever trying to learn all I can about a topic so I am the expert. We are making two posts almost every week, and there just isn't the time to research a topic to expert level. Some post are reflective where we cannot just research, we have to look inside ourselves for the content.
					</p>
					<p>
						The upside of all this pressure to blog is that I no longer fear blogging. I can research a topic enough to write about it. I can reflect on the personal post topics and express what I am thinking. I do not know that I will blog at the same rate after Dev Bootcamp, but I know that I can blog, and the research needed for a blog post is a great way to start exploring a new technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						A side of this blogging experience is the creation of this blog site. It initially was quite crude, but has evloved in to something much nicer as my skills have improved. I have learned to look at the blogs of others and for things I like, see how they made that work and then add it to my site. I am not sure how long I want to keep doing this, as I am feeling the urge to have comments, and more managed post control.
