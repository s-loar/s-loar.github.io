						I think all of us feel anxiety when it comes time to perform in a group setting, whether that is
taking a test in school, or giving a talk to a group. In the past, when faced with this anxiety, and the thought that I cannot do this
comes into my head, I stop myself and think of the accomplishments and acheivements I have had in the past and that this anxiety is unfounded
because I have done harder things than this. This gives me the confidence to go on. But it has not always been possible to be aware of 
slipping into anxiety, anger, or other strong emotions.
