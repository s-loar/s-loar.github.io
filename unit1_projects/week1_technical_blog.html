						<h1>Analysis of 3 Sites</h1>
					</header>

					<p>
						This is an analysis of three of my favorite websites.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first site I will look at is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. I like this site because it has a lot of news on technical items on a wide range of topics. Visually there is not much to it. At the top is the header/logo with some simple navigation and below that is the list of articles from other sites. The articles have a title and some minor information and you pretty much just click any story that sounds interesting and you are take to that site to read it. This makes the site simple and practicle, almost spartan, but that is also it's strength, as there isn't anything to distract you. If you are looking for something specific, you can use the search box at the bottom of the page. You can browse by clicking "More" which pages you into older content. It's all very simple.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next site is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>. I like this site, as it is sort of a one stop for all shopping. When you arrive on the site, you are visually drawn to the center of the page where the current specials stand out prominantly. But the power of the site is found above in the search box, when you can search for just about anything you can think of to buy. The site is bright and colorful and gives a happy and comfortable feeling.
						If you wish to browse the content there is navigation on the side to allow you to drill down into categories of products. You can spend a lot of time here browsing and seeing what the site suggests to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						The third site is the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/">BBC</a>. I like this site for it coverage of world news from a perspective that is not biased by US politics. When you arrive at the site the most prominant feature is the large rotating images of top stories. Below that are what are lesser stories, grouped by category. Visually there is a lot to this site, but the images are set up in a distinct hierarchy so you are visually guided from most important to least important. The site feel both informative and entertaining, and the BBC name brings a level of trust. to find something specific, you can use the search box at the top ot the page where the category navigation is also useful for browsing the site.
