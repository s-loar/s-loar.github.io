						<h1>Week 7 Cultural Post - Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1>
						<section class="postdate">

					<p>
						For week 7 of Phase 0 at DBC we have been given the task to write about the following.
					</p>
					<p>
						Revisit your "Affirming your Values" blog post and relate it to what you learned about stereotype threat.
How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you are in it?
Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?
					</p>
					<p>
						I think all of us feel anxiety when it comes time to perform in a group setting, whether that is
taking a test in school, or giving a talk to a group. In the past, when faced with this anxiety, and the thought that I cannot do this
comes into my head, I stop myself and think of the accomplishments and acheivements I have had in the past and that this anxiety is unfounded
because I have done harder things than this. This gives me the confidence to go on. But it has not always been possible to be aware of 
slipping into anxiety, anger, or other strong emotions.
					</p>
					<p>
						From the DBC readings on meditation and self awareness, I am becoming aware of when I slip into feeling anxious, angry or any strong
emotion. I am also beginning to recognize situations where I know that these things often happen, like meetings, or when giving presentations. 
I now start watching myself for the thoughts that go with these feelings and head them off by focusing on my breathing and 
thinking positive, uplifting things to myself.
					</p>
					<p>
						I know that while at DBC I will feel highly stressed, anxious, and exhausted at times, and I will want to think that I cannot get through it, but
I will say to myself that I got through phase 0 while working full time. I will look back on this accomplishment and push through. 
I will focus on my breathing, slow it down and feel the emotion go away. I have also learned that taking short mental breaks is helpful. 
For me this involves getting away from working, usually going outside for fresh air and a short walk. Exercise also is great for stress reduction and 
helping me feel refreshed and happy. I am also expecting that pairing, helping and interacting with my cohort will help me feel happy and 
energized. I hope this feeling and energy will carry over to them to also feel happy, energized and good about themselves as well.
